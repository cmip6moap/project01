These are the CMIP6 global mean TAS monthly timeseries (RAW)

The scripts are in the directory "code/Kelvin"

A very rough check has been done and the ensemble mean of the TAS time series looks ok.

There are some files missing files because the source TAS files are not found on JASMIN.
==> I will download those files from elsewhere if they are available.

IMPORTANT!
==> You NEED to set 0 to nan.
